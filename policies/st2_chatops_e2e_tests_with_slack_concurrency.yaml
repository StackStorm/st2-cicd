# ChatOps end-to-end tests with Slack run configured with different channels so
# they do not interfere with each other.
# However, we still need to ensure that multiple end-to-end test runs do not
# interfere with each other, so we restrict the
# st2.st2_chatops_e2e_tests_with_slack to only run one action at a time for
# each different Slack channel.
